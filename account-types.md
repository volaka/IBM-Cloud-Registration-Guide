## Pay as you Go Account

With a Pay-As-You-Go account, you can access the full IBM Cloud catalog, including all free plans, and you get double the free runtime memory at 512 MB per month. You pay only for billable services that you use, with no long-term contracts or commitments. When you upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account, you receive a [$200 credit](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accounts#upgrade-lite-account) to help get you started.

You can create multiple resource groups to easily manage quota and view billing usage for a set of resources. Your charges are based on your use of IBM Cloud computing and services. If you use more than the free runtime and service allowances, you receive a monthly invoice that provides details about your resource charges.

Basic support is included with your IBM Cloud Pay-As-You-Go. It is provided for non-production environments or workloads where traditional severities are not used and specific response times are not stipulated. Also, with a Pay-As-You-Go account, you can order Advanced or Premium support plans to get extra help with your production workloads. Learn more in [Support plans](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-support-plans).
